[Shadowing Calculation on Urban Areas from Semantic 3D City Models](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43699-4_2)

In this paper, we present our method to perform shadowing calculations in urban areas using semantic 3D city models, which is split into five sections: Point Grid Generation, Sun-Ray Generation, Nightside Filtering, Bounding Volume Hierarchy and the intersection between the sun rays and the BVH to identify which locations are shadowed at a given moment (epoch). Our tests are performed in Rotterdam's city center, a dense urban area in The Netherlands. Our initial results indicate that the computational time per 100 k grid points fluctuates within 0.2–0.7s.
